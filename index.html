    <h1>About This Site</h1>
    <p>This portfolio all about Macie Ryan was created, originally, for a project for COP1500. Throughout the process of
        this site, we were asked to check the site's accessibility, contrast, and usability. With the <a
                href="http://wave.webaim.org"> WAVE Web Accessibility Tool</a>, I was alerted of a couple things on my
        site.</p>
    <p>I changed the color of the tabs from a lighter pink (#FFB6C1) to a darker purple (#8B3288) so that those with all
        sorts of eyes and eye conditions are able to properly navigate through my site. In respect to the styles on my
        portfolio, I often started with "h2"'s instead of "h1"'s because I thought the first headers seemed a little too
        big. After reviewing this site, I realized it only makes sense, and it doesn't look too big to start with a
        h1.</p>
